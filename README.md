# AnimatedStories

Hello my friend!

This project was created based on the idea of the site https://iamtired.online/. The idea was modified and something punk-philosophical turned out.
*The main page contains a small psychological short story.
*About us is about me (nothing interesting).
*Creating a story is the idea of creating animated stories by the user. We write the text, upload a picture for it. The picture is converted to black and white and the text takes on animation. (This page is under development)
